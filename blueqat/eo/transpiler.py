"""The 'eo' backend: transpile a logical Circuit into exchange pulses.

    import blueqat.eo  # registers the backend
    physical = Circuit(2).h[0].cx[0, 1].run(backend='eo')

Logical qubit i is encoded in physical spins 3i, 3i+1, 3i+2, and the output
is an ordinary Circuit containing only `exch` pulses, runnable on any
simulation backend. All logical gates are exact up to global phase.

Topology note: the emitted pulses assume any pair inside the two triples
involved in a gate can be pulsed (in particular, the Fong-Wandzura CNOT's
bridge pulse connects spin 3c+2 with spin 3t+2, and the encoded SWAP pulses
pair the triples spin-by-spin). This is always fine for simulation; mapping
onto strict nearest-neighbor-only hardware additionally requires dot
orientation assignment and spin-level SWAP routing, which is future work
(cf. exchange-pulse-optimizer).
