"""The 3-spin decoherence-free-subsystem (DFS) encoding of exchange-only qubits.

One logical qubit lives in the total-spin S=1/2 sector of 3 physical spins
(spin up = ``|0>``, physical qubit 3i+k is spin k of logical qubit i, qubit 0 is
the least-significant statevector bit, as everywhere in this SDK):

    ``|0_L>`` = ``|singlet(0,1)>`` ``|up(2)>``
    ``|1_L>`` = sqrt(2/3) ``|T+(0,1)>`` ``|down(2)>`` - sqrt(1/3) ``|T0(0,1)>`` ``|up(2)>``

Each logical state comes in two "gauge" copies, the total-Sz m=+1/2 sector
above and its m=-1/2 partner; exchange acts identically on both, and any
population in the fully symmetric S=3/2 quadruplet is leakage.
